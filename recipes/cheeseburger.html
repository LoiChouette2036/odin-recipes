      <p>A cheeseburger is a classic American dish consisting of a beef patty grilled or fried and served on a bun with cheese and various toppings.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef(80/20 blend)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (American or cheddar)</li>
        <li>4 burgers buns</li>
        <li>lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Condiments(ketchup,mustard,mayonnaise)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties, making them slightly larger than the burger buns.</li>
        <li>Season the patties generously with salt and black pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Grill or cook the patties in a skillet for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked to your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>Top each patty with a slice of cheese and allow it to melt.</li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking, prepare the toppings by slicing the lettuce, tomato, and onion.</li>
        <li>Toast the burger buns on the grill or in the oven.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers by placing the cooked patty with melted cheese on the bottom bun, then adding the lettuce, tomato, onion, and condiments of your choice.</li>
        <li>Top with the other half of the bun and serve hot.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That's a basic cheeseburger recipe, but you can customize it by adding other toppings such as bacon, avocado, or pickles to make it your own. Enjoy!</p>
